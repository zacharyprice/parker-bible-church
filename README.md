✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/angular-monorepo-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

[Click here to finish setting up your workspace!](https://cloud.nx.app/connect/lmupYWaScI)

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve parker-bible-church
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build parker-bible-church
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project parker-bible-church
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.

## Optional Additions:

Looking at your monorepo structure more comprehensively, here are some additional elements that might be missing from your initial setup:

### Additional Elements to Consider

1. Configuration Library
   Store environment-specific configurations, feature flags, and app settings
   Auth Library

2. Authentication/authorization logic that might be needed for admin sections
   Testing Library

3. Custom test utilities, mocks, and test helpers
   Layout Library

4. Common layouts like header, footer, navigation
   Infrastructure

5. CI/CD Configuration: You have the GitHub workflow but might need deployment scripts
   Docker configuration for containerization
   Docs folder for project documentation

6. Developer Experience Tools
   Custom Nx generators for scaffolding specific patterns
   Stricter ESLint/Prettier configurations
   Husky for Git hooks (pre-commit linting, etc.)

7. API Layer
   Consider libraries for API connectivity
   State Management

8. If you plan to use NgRx or another state management solution
   Web Components Library

9. If you plan to share components with non-Angular applications
   Assets Library

10. Shared images, fonts, icons, and other static assets
    For a church website specifically, you might also consider domain-specific libraries:

- events - For church events calendar functionality
- sermons - For sermon archives and playback
- giving - For online donations
- ministries - For information about church ministries

These additions would provide a more complete foundation as your application grows.
